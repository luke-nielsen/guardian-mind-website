This data helps us understand user engagement and improve the website's functionality. It is anonymized and does not include personally identifiable details.</p>
        <p><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Our accountability software captures screenshots, which are stored in a secure database. These screenshots are associated with the parent’s account and can only be accessed by the parent or authorized account holder.</p>

        <h3>4. Security Measures</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
        <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill orders or provide customer service, after which it is securely deleted.</p>
        <p><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Screenshots are retained based on the settings configured by the parent or account holder, and parents can delete screenshots associated with their account at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>Anonymized Data:</strong> Website interaction data that has been anonymized may be retained indefinitely for analytical purposes.</p>
